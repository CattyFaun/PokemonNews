                When you get in the game you select your starter Pokémon which is Feucoco, Sprigatito, and Quaxly, from there you meet your new friend at the academy and start your Pokémon journey.
                There are three different paths you go on, The 8 gym badges you collect similar to the other Pokémon games, the 5 team star badges you must collect by defeating team stars bases, and the path of legends,
                in which you fight 5 different titan Pokémon to get herba mystica and give your ride Pokémon new abilities. You also have the ability to freely roam around and catch all 400 Pokémon in the Paldea region
                and challenge Pokémon in tera raids ranging from 1-7 stars getting Pokémon with unique tera types.
