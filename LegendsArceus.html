      <h1>Features Added In Legend of Arceus</h1>
      <h3>Alpha Pokémon & Mass Outbreaks</h3>
      <p>
          In Pokémon Legends of Arceus two new features were added one of them being Alpha Pokémon and the other being mass outbreaks and massive mass outbreaks. Alpha Pokémon are the same as regular Pokémon they
          are just larger, there static alpha spawns around the map of all the regions and there is also a three percent chance of any Pokémon being an alpha. The only Pokémon that cannot be alphas are the
          legendary Pokémon or quest rewarded Pokémon. You can also find these Alpha Pokémon as shinies with a lot of time and dedication. Another unique feature they added in Legends of Arceus was mass outbreaks and
          massive mass outbreaks, mass outbreaks are an outbreak of one species of Pokémon where that single Pokémon spawns anywhere between 8-15 with increased shiny odds. Massive mass outbreaks are the same except
          they are encountered in the post game, with massive mass outbreaks there are multiple different outbreaks going on at the same time. These outbreaks also have a chance to spawn in another horde of Pokémon after
          you clear the first one, typically being the next evolution of that Pokémon species, the only downside is these massive mass outbreaks have a lower shiny odd than regular mass outbreaks.
